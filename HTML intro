Attributes
  href: This attribute's value specifies the web address that you want the link to point to; where the browser navigates to when the link is clicked. For example, href="https://www.mozilla.org/".
  title: The title attribute specifies extra information about the link, such as what page is being linked to. For example, title="The Mozilla homepage". This will appear as a tooltip when the element is hovered over.
  target: The target attribute specifies the browsing context that will be used to display the link. For example, target="_blank" will display the link in a new tab. If you want to display the link in the current tab, just omit this attribute.
    example: 
    <p>A link to my <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/" title="The Mozilla homepage" target="_blank">favorite website</a>.</p>
    
Boolean Attributes
  disabled: if you want them to be disabled (greyed out) so the user can't enter any data in them.
    examples:
    <!-- using the disabled attribute prevents the end user from entering text into the input box -->
    <input type="text" disabled>
    <input type="text" disabled="disabled">
    
    <!-- The user can enter text into the follow input, as it doesn't contain the disabled attribute -->
    <input type="text"> 
    
Anatomy of an HTML document
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>My test page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This is my page</p>
  </body>
</html>

<!DOCTYPE html> is the shortest string of characters that counts as a valid doctype
<html></html>: The <html> element. 
  This element wraps all the content on the entire page, and is sometimes known as the root element.
<head></head>: The <head> element. 
  This element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page, that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more. You'll learn more about this in the next article of the series.
<meta charset="utf-8">: 
  This element specifies the character set for your document to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of human written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it can help avoid some problems later.
<title></title>: The <title> element. 
  This sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in, and is used to describe the page when you bookmark/favorite it.
<body></body>: The <body> element. 
  This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
  
    example:
